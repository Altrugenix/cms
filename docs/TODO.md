# TODO — Altrugenix CMS

> Project status: Milestone 8 complete. **~430 tests** across all packages. Documentation site live at apps/docs. Audits complete (performance, security, accessibility). All content workflow features done (draft/publish, soft delete, scheduled publishing, version history, localization). Standalone app started — `cms dev` now starts a full Fastify server with REST + GraphQL + schema watching.

## Milestone 9: Standalone CMS App (Next)

### Objective

Make `cms dev` work like Strapi — a single command that starts a full CMS server (REST + GraphQL + admin panel) with zero configuration. The package `@altrugenix/cms` exposes a `cms` binary so it works via:

```bash
npm install -g @altrugenix/cms     # global install → `cms dev`
npm install @altrugenix/cms         # local dep → `yarn cms dev` / `npx cms dev`
npx @altrugenix/cms dev             # one-off, no install
```

Currently the API server lives in `apps/api` and the CLI is a schema watcher that doesn't start an HTTP server.

### CLI Server Integration (`packages/cms`)

- [x] Move server bootstrap code from `apps/api/src/index.ts` into `packages/cms/src/commands/dev.ts`
- [x] Support flags: `--port`, `--host`, `--schema-dir`, `--db-url`, `--db-adapter`
- [x] Auto-detect and create SQLite database file on first run (`cms.db`)
- [x] Add all server dependencies to CLI package.json
- [x] Copy all API server code (plugins, routes, services) into `packages/cms/src/server/`
- [x] Extract shared bootstrap logic into `packages/cms/src/server/bootstrap.ts`
- [x] Wire schema watcher into server hot-reload (debounced close + re-create Fastify)
- [x] Add `cms start` command for production (no file watching, no hot-reload)
- [x] Auto-migrate on startup: `getExistingSchema` added to DatabaseAdapter interface and implemented in SQLite + Postgres adapters; `connectAndLoad` now generates and runs pending migrations

### Admin Panel Bundling (`apps/admin`)

- [x] Make the admin panel build to a static directory that the API server serves
- [x] Configure Vite build output — production mode uses relative API URLs
- [x] Serve static admin panel from Fastify with SPA `index.html` fallback via `@fastify/static`
- [x] Add environment-aware admin URL: dev uses Vite dev server (port 5173), production uses bundled static
- [x] Auto-build admin panel as part of `cms build` pipeline before server build

### Package Restructuring

- [x] Rename `@altrugenix/cli` → `@altrugenix/cms` as the main package
- [x] Rename directory `packages/cli/` → `packages/cms/`
- [x] Update all workspace references, docs, changesets, lockfile
- [x] Verify `packages/cms/bin/cms.js` entry point with proper shebang
- [x] Verify pack tarball: 42KB, includes `dist/` + `bin/cms.js` + `package.json` with resolved workspace versions
- [x] Bump all packages to v0.1.0 via changeset
- [x] Fix bin field format in cms and create-app (use object form)
- [ ] Publish `@altrugenix/cms` and all `@altrugenix/*` workspace packages to npm via GitHub Actions

### Scaffolding (`create-altrugenix-app`)

- [x] Create `packages/create-app/` with `create-altrugenix-app` CLI
- [x] Prompt for project name, database choice, default locale
- [x] Scaffold example project with `cms/collections/`, `cms/globals/`, `.env`, config
- [x] Add `"dev": "cms dev"`, `"build": "cms build"`, `"start": "cms start"` scripts
- [x] Fix bin field format
- [ ] Publish `create-altrugenix-app` to npm via GitHub Actions

### Production Build (`cms build`)

- [x] Build admin panel + server code in one command
- [x] Support `--out-dir` flag with full production bundle assembly
- [x] Generate `package.json`, `Dockerfile`, and `.dockerignore` in output

### Documentation

- [x] Update root README with `npx @altrugenix/cms dev` quick start
- [x] Write "Usage as a Standalone App" guide in `docs/standalone-usage.md`
- [ ] Create v0.2.0 release (after npm publish via GitHub Actions)
